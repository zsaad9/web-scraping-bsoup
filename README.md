# web-scraping-bsoup
In this project I analyzed word frequency in the novel "Little Women" using Python libraries like NLTK. I scraped the web, extracted data with BeautifulSoup, and applied NLP techniques to understand the novel's linguistic patterns. This project demonstrates a versatile data pipeline for textual analysis.
